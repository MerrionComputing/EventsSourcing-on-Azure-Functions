Listeners
=========

The listeners react to events in the commands, queries, projections and classifiers that kick off the steps required to perform the
actions of those.  

The listener uses the event stream backing the command, query, projection or classifier to store/track progress.  This is conceptually
similar to an orchestration, albeit with more constrained actions.

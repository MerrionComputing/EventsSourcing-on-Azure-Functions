Transfers
=========

A transfer is a money movement between accounts.  
It is used to demonstrate the idea of saga-based actions as replacements for the traditional database concept of transactions.

A transfer can succeed or fail due to the conditions of source and target account (assuming both are "ours") 
and a failed transfer should set back the accounts to the state they were in before it.
